            <h3>Healthy Ways to Gain Weight If Youâ€™re Underweight</h3>
            <p className="first before-p">Weight loss is a serious issue in the United States. Consumers constantly see advertisements and news reports on trendy diets, flashy products, and magic pills promising to help them lose weight.</p>
<p className="after-p before-h2">Given that the ongoing &ldquo;battle of the bulge&rdquo; is front and center for so many people, being too thin may seem like a good problem to have. But the reality is that being underweight can cause health problems.</p>

          </div>
         <div className="hint-container">
            <h3>
            Path to improved wellness
            </h3>
            <p className="after-h2 before-p">Fat has a bad reputation for causing people to be overweight and obese. However, not all fat is bad. In fact, breaking down and storing energy (calories) as fat is good. It&rsquo;s just one of the many ways the body uses food to function, heal, and grow.</p>
<p className="after-p before-p">Stored energy from fat helps you get through a strenuous job or workout. It plays a key role in brain development, and in preventing inflammation (swelling) and blood clots. Fat contributes to healthy hair and skin, as well.</p>
<p className="after-p before-p">You can determine whether you are underweight by using a&nbsp;<a href="https://familydoctor.org/bmi-calculator/">Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator</a>. This online tool considers your weight, height, age, and gender to calculate a score. If your BMI is less than 18.5, you are underweight. Your doctor also can help determine if you&rsquo;re underweight based on your height, weight, what you eat, and your activity level.</p>
<p className="after-p before-p">Your doctor may put you on a weight gain program if you are underweight. However, this is not permission to go crazy with junk food. Healthy weight gain requires a balanced approach, just like a weight loss program.</p>
<p className="after-p before-ul">Eating junk food may result in weight gain. However, it will not satisfy the nutrition your body needs. Even if the fat, sugar, and salt in junk food doesn&rsquo;t result as extra weight, it can still harm your body. For a healthy weight gain, the following tips can help:</p>
<ul className="after-p before-p">
<li className="first before-li"><strong>Add healthy calories.&nbsp;</strong>You don&rsquo;t need to drastically change your diet. You can increase calories by adding nut or seed toppings, cheese, and healthy side dishes. Try almonds, sunflower seeds, fruit, or whole-grain, wheat toast.</li>
<li className="after-li before-li"><strong>Go nutrient dense.&nbsp;</strong>Instead of eating empty calories and junk food, eat foods that are rich in nutrients. Consider high-protein meats, which can help you to build muscle. Also, choose nutritious carbohydrates, such as brown rice and other whole grains. This helps ensure your body is receiving as much nourishment as possible, even if you&rsquo;re dealing with a reduced appetite.</li>
<li className="after-li before-li"><strong>Snack away.&nbsp;</strong>Enjoy snacks that contain plenty of protein and healthy carbohydrates. Consider options like trail mix, protein bars or drinks, and crackers with hummus or peanut butter. Also, enjoy snacks that contain &ldquo;<a href="https://familydoctor.org/dietary-fats-whats-good-and-whats-bad/">good fats</a>,&rdquo; which are important for a healthy heart. Examples include nuts and avocados.</li>
<li className="after-li before-li"><strong>Eat mini-meals.&nbsp;</strong>If you&rsquo;re struggling with a poor appetite, due to medical or emotional issues, eating large amounts of food may not seem appealing. Consider eating smaller meals throughout the day to increase your calorie intake.</li>
<li className="after-li last"><strong>Bulk up.&nbsp;</strong>While too much aerobic exercise will burn calories and work against your weight goal, strength training can help. This includes weightlifting or yoga. You gain weight by building muscle.</li>
</ul>
<p className="after-ul before-h2">Before beginning a weight gain program, talk to your doctor. Being underweight may be due to an underlying health problem. It won&rsquo;t be corrected by diet changes. Your doctor will be able to help you track your progress. He or she will make sure that healthy changes are taking place.</p>

            Things to consider
            </h3>
            <p className="after-h2 before-ul">People who are underweight typically are not getting enough calories to fuel their bodies. Often, they are also suffering from malnutrition. Malnutrition means you are not taking in enough vitamins and minerals from your food. If you&rsquo;re underweight, you may be at risk for the following health issues:</p>
<ul className="after-p before-p">
<li className="first before-li"><strong>Delayed growth and development.</strong>&nbsp;This is especially true in children and teens, whose bodies need plenty of nutrients to grow and stay healthy.</li>
<li className="after-li before-li"><strong>Fragile bones.</strong>&nbsp;A deficiency in vitamin D and calcium, along with low body weight, can lead to weak bones and&nbsp;<a href="https://familydoctor.org/condition/osteoporosis/">osteoporosis</a>.</li>
<li className="after-li before-li"><strong>Weakened immune system.</strong>&nbsp;When you don&rsquo;t get enough nutrients, your body cannot store energy. This makes it difficult to fight illness. It may also be difficult for your immune system to recover after being sick.</li>
<li className="after-li before-li"><a href="https://familydoctor.org/condition/anemia/"><strong>Anemia.</strong></a>&nbsp;This condition can be caused by not having enough of the vitamins iron, folate, and B12. This can cause dizziness, fatigue, and headaches.</li>
<li className="after-li before-li"><strong>Fertility issues.</strong>&nbsp;In women, low body weight can lead to irregular periods, lack of periods, and infertility.</li>
<li className="after-li last"><a href="https://familydoctor.org/condition/hair-loss/"><strong>Hair loss.</strong></a>&nbsp;Low body weight can cause hair to thin and fall out easily. It also can cause dry, thin skin and health issues with teeth and gums.</li>
</ul>
<p className="after-ul before-ul">Many underweight people are physically healthy. Low body weight is due to a variety of causes, including:</p>
<ul className="after-p before-h3">
<li className="first before-li"><strong>Genetics.</strong>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve been thin since high school and it runs in your family, it&rsquo;s likely that you were born with a higher-than-usual metabolism. You also may have a naturally small appetite.</li>
<li className="after-li before-li"><strong>High physical activity.</strong>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re an athlete, you probably know that frequent workouts can affect your body weight. However, high physical activity also can be a part of an active job or an energetic personality. If you&rsquo;re on your feet a lot, you may burn more calories than people who are more sedentary (inactive).</li>
<li className="after-li before-li"><strong>Illness.</strong>&nbsp;Being sick can affect your appetite and your body&rsquo;s ability to use and store food. If you&rsquo;ve recently lost a lot of weight without trying, it may be a sign of disease, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://familydoctor.org/condition/thyroiditis/">thyroid problems</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://familydoctor.org/condition/diabetes/">diabetes</a>, digestive diseases, or even&nbsp;<a href="https://familydoctor.org/condition/cancer/">cancer</a>. Talk to your doctor about sudden weight loss.</li>
<li className="after-li before-li"><strong>Medicines.</strong>&nbsp;Certain prescription medicines can cause nausea and weight loss. Some treatments, such as chemotherapy, can reduce appetite and worsen weight loss from illness.</li>
<li className="after-li last"><strong>Psychological issues.</strong>&nbsp;Our mental well being affects every part of our lives. Things like&nbsp;<a href="https://familydoctor.org/stress-how-to-cope-better-with-lifes-challenges/">stress&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://familydoctor.org/condition/depression/">depression&nbsp;</a>can disrupt healthy eating habits. Severe body image fears and distortions can lead to eating disorders. If you&rsquo;re suffering from damaging emotional issues, talk to your doctor. He or she can help you get the care, assistance, or counseling you may need.</li>

            <h3>
            Questions to ask your doctor
            </h3>
            <p>
              Most people are surprised to learn that eating 5 or 6 times a day
              can be a better way to lose weight than eating only 3 times a day!
              This only works, however, if you take care to control not only the
              calorie content but also the amount of food you&rsquo;re eating.
              &nbsp;The goal is to eat a small amount of food &ndash; like a cup
              of no-fat yoghurt, for example &ndash; every 3 hours or so.
              &nbsp;Eat only enough so that you don&rsquo;t feel hungry, but
              never so much that you feel stuffed. Some people recommend eating
              your meals off of smaller plates, because research has shown that
              people have a tendency to try to eat all of what is served to
              them. Unfortunately, portion sizes for restaurant meals and other
              prepared foods, and even in our homes &ndash; everything from
              breakfast muffins to a plate of spaghetti &ndash; have grown to
              very unhealthy proportions in the last two decades.
            </p>

         <div className="hint-container">
            <h3>
              Eat Less Cholesterol and Less Fat &ndash; Especially Less
              Saturated Fat, and Almost No Trans-Fat
            </h3>
            <p>
              Most people have heard that cholesterol is bad, and eating less of
              it is important. &nbsp;But our bodies also make cholesterol from
              the fats that we eat. Fats are also very high in calories. So
              cutting down on total fat intake is helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
              All fats, however, are not alike, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s
              important to check food labels to be sure that you&rsquo;re eating
              the smallest amount of saturated fat and of trans fat possible.
              These tend to be the kinds of fat that are found in milk and milk
              products, those that are solid at room temperature &ndash; like
              the fat in meat products, butter, margarine, shortening and lard
              &ndash; and the fats that come from baked goods and fried foods.
              The fats you do eat should be mostly &ldquo;unsaturated&rdquo; or
              &ldquo;polyunsaturated&rdquo; fats. Although there are some
              exceptions, these tend to be liquid at room temperature, like
              canola oil, olive oil and some of the other vegetable oils.

                healthy food guidelines

              . What these diets have in common includes recommendations to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Aim for at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day.
                Usually, the more colorful the fruit or vegetable, the more
                nutritious. For example, dark green spinach has more nutrients
                than light green iceberg lettuce.
              </li>
              <li>
                Try and choose whole grain cereal, pasta, rice, and bread. Many
                foods that claim &ldquo;whole wheat&rdquo; or &ldquo;whole
                grain&rdquo; on the front of the package are really made with
                mostly white, processed flour &ndash; which isn&rsquo;t nearly
                as nutritious. Always check the ingredients to see if
                &ldquo;whole wheat&rdquo; or &ldquo;whole grain&rdquo; is
                thefirstingredient listed. And don&rsquo;t be fooled by how a
                food looks. For example, some dark brown breads are colored with
                coffee or other dyes, not whole grains. And remember, whole
                grain rice is brown, not white rice.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid food that is high in sugar, like pastries, sweetened
                cereal, and soda or fruit-flavored drinks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reduced-fat or no-fat (skim) milk, reduced-fat cheese, and
                low-fat or no-fat yoghurt are good sources of the protein and
                calcium we need. Try to eat 2-4 servings of low-fat or no-fat
                dairy products each day.

            <h3>Exercise Does More Than Burn Calories</h3>
            <p>
              Increasing the amount of exercise you do each day means you burn
              more calories to help you lose weight. &nbsp;And, research has
              shown very clearly that 30 minutes of moderately strenuous daily
              exercise is also one of the most important requirements for
              disease prevention &ndash; even for people who are already at an
              ideal weight. &nbsp;The exercise you choose doesn&rsquo;t need to
              be elaborate, or to take place in a gym. &nbsp;Walking, biking,
              swimming, or gardening can do the trick, and getting a friend or
              family member to exercise with you can turn this into a valued
              part of your daily routine. &nbsp;Learn more about the health

            <h3>Staying Healthy is a Life-Long Proposition</h3>
            <p>
              When we think about dieting, most of us think about setting a
              weight-loss goal that will determine how long we watch what
              we&rsquo;re eating. &nbsp;A better way to think about it might be
              to ask yourself the question: How long do I want to try to avoid
              developing chronic disease? Put in those terms, it&rsquo;s easy to
              see that getting control of BMI and eating foods that contribute
              to continuing good health (or that don&rsquo;t directly contribute
              to the development of dangerous disease conditions) is not a
              short-term goal. &nbsp;For many of us, doing what it takes to get
              our BMI into a healthy range and to keep it there means learning
              to live our lives in a new way. Scientists have found that one of
              the keys to success is to think about these goals every day. For
              example, people who get on a scale and check their weight daily
              are more successful at keeping their weight under control than
              people who don&rsquo;t.

              important thing to remember is that weight loss is not the only

              developing chronic disease and dying younger as low as possible.
              &nbsp;Fad diets, diet pills, protein powders, liposuction, and
              even intestinal or gastric bypass surgery might provide a leaner
              profile, but they don&rsquo;t provide the nutrients needed to keep
